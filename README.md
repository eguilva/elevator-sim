# Elevator Simulation Project
___
This Java project simulates an elevator system in a multi-story building. 
It models elevator movement, pickup, and drop-off of tasks in real time, 
using realistic parameters such as:  
- Elevator speed: 1 meter/sec 
- Floor height: 3 meters 
- Task creation and handling with timestamps

The scheduler prioritizes tasks based on the elevatorâ€™s current position, ensuring all requests are serviced efficiently. Each task tracks pickup, drop-off, and completion times, providing detailed logs for analysis.
